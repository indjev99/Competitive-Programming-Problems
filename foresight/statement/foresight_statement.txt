Zhuge Liang, courtesy name Kongming, wants to restore the Han dynasty to power.
After unifying Shu Han, he is planning an expedition against Cao Wei.
China consists of N teritories and M bidirectional roads that take one day each.
Formally, it is an unweighted undirected multi graph with loops.
The army stars in teritory S and has to reach T by traveling only on roads.
However, at some point during the expedition, while the army is in some teritory,
the enemy may blockade one of the roads of their choosing.
The army will find out about this as soon as it happens and may then change its course.
Zhuge Liang has foreseen this possibility and wants to select a route from S to T
that minimizes the total travel time in the worst-case scenario.
Write a program that finds the optimal worst-case travel time and an optimal route.

Input:
N M S T
A_0 B_0
...
A_{M - 1} B_{M - 1}

Output:
If there is such a path with length K:
Time K
P_0 ... P_K
Otherwise:
-1

Sample test:

Input:
7 10 0 6
0 1
0 2
1 1
1 3
2 3
3 4
3 4
4 5
4 6
5 6

Output:
6 4
0 1 3 4 6

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1e5
0 <= M <= 10 N
0 <= S, T, A_i, B_i < N

Time limit:
1.7 secs on our system
About 1.7x the time of subtask4_mlog,
which 2x the non-input time + the input time.
Enough so that subtask4_mlog_slow passes,
but subtask3_mlog2 does not.

Memory limit:
512 MB

Subtasks:
1. 17 points: N <= 1e3
2. 19 points: N <= 4e3
3. 43 points: N <= 3e4
4. 21 points: N <= 1e5

To get the points for a subtask, your solution must pass it and all subtasks before it.
